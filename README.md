day_night_mode

Since mpv player is great player with rtsp protocol, I decided write this code so that you can switch parameters in ip cameras through keybind of mpv player. In this case, it switches the infrared light to on or off. To communicate with tapo cameras to switch some parameters we use the pytapo repository.
